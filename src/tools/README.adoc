== `bootstrap` directory

Under this directory, installation steps for "bootstrap" tools are defined.
Tools installed during this step will be used for installation of the other tools, which happens after "bootstrap" step.

Followings tools are installed in this step.:

- brew
- jq
- (modern) bash
- emacs

Generally speaking, including a tool like emacs isn't a good idea in bootstrap, but the author of `macaboard` is very bad at playing with `vi`.
In future versions, perhaps, it will be replaced with `nano` or just removed (if he learns a way to live with `vi` ;)).
